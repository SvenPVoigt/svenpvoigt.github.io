I develop knowledge graphs for knowledge management, analysis & visualization, AI, and R&D. Currently working on:
- Software for collaborative knowledge management that will unlock the potential of AI for organizations.
- Publishing papers on knowledge management and schema design.
- Collaborating on knowledge graph constructions across academia and industry.
- Collaborating on AI analysis & visualization to unlock value of organization's data equity.
- Contributing to open source graph databases.

My research at Georgia Tech involved developing new knowledge graph schemas and schema technologies to represent a large multi-modal set of materials knowledge. Applications required text to knowledge extraction, image to knowledge extraction, and extraction of key features from other datatypes using ad-hoc methods for simple datatypes and end-to-end deep learning for more complex datatypes like scientific measurements.

Degrees earned include a *Material Science Ph.D.* and *Computer Science M.S.* from **Georgia Tech**, and a *Materials Science M.S.* and *B.S.* from **CWRU**.

I enjoy traveling, running, yoga, calisthenics, and rock climbing.

My personal philosophy is always evolving but focused around meaning and purpose being under our own control- creativity and perception are the key to unlocking personal growth and happiness. I believe that focus, vision, and effort lead success and accomplishments.
